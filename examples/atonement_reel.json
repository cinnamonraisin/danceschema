I announced that the dance had no name yet, whereupon David Handwerker reminded me it was the Yom Kippur, \"The Day of Atonement\".This dance borrows the promenade into circular wave balance from \"Ted's Mixer\" by Ted Sannella. I wanted the progression to be at the end so there was at least one balance and swing with the original partner.",
